            <h3>Who We Are</h3>

            <p class="">HOPEWELL HAVEN CENTRE is a non-governmental organization dedicated to
            improving the lives of vulnerable populations across five counties in Kenya namely:- Nakuru,
            Narok, Laikipia, Nyandarua and Kericho. HOPEWELL HAVEN CENTRE recognizes the
            interconnectedness of various social issues and aims to address them comprehensively
            through programs focused on education, health, human rights, disability inclusion, and
            poverty alleviation.</p>

            <h3>When We Began</h3>
            <p>Was established in July 2023</p>

            <h3>The situation/the need</h3>
            <p class="">In the heart of Kenya, amidst its diverse landscapes and vibrant cultures, lie communities
            grappling with multifaceted challenges that undermine their well-being and hinder their
            progress. Within the five counties mentioned above, these challenges manifest in the form of
            entrenched poverty, limited access to education and healthcare, violations of human rights,
            exclusion of persons with disabilities, and persistent socio-economic inequalities.
            Recognizing the urgency of addressing these issues, the HOPEWELL HAVEN CENTRE
            (HHC) emerges as a beacon of hope, driven by a vision of inclusive development and social
            justice.</p>

            <h3>What we are doing</h3>
            <p class="">Our programs in Nakuru County have successfully done needs assessment and recruited 30
            teen mothers, who dropped out of school after they became pregnant and others after delivery
            and are willing to continue schooling or join a TVET institution to attend vocational training.
            2 have already gone back to formal schooling and other 4 are attending vocational trainings.
            15 will be joining school/vocational training in January 2025 while other 9 will join
            schooling in march and May 2025 since their children are still very young. This will boost
            return-to-school rate for those enrolled. This has been made possible by local donations and
            limited government bursaries. Our programs are designed in collaboration with local
            community leaders, government officials, and beneficiaries to ensure they meet the actual
            needs of the communities.</p>
            <h3>Vision statement</h3>

            <h3>Mission statement</h3>
            <p class="">To empower vulnerable populations by improving access to quality education, healthcare,

            partnerships to ensure holistic development.</p>
